This is the sample architecture project that described in [my medium article.](https://medium.com/@kirsapps/my-vision-of-flutter-app-architecture-a80fd8824568)

There are main features:
* The **file structure** is easy to understand and easy to extend.
* The **dependency injection** is **compile-time safe** without global variables and singletons.
* The **environment management** is available with custom configs and dependencies.
* The **error handling** integrated. It captures all errors which can appear in the app.
* The **logging** is available with the DeLog.
* The **developer part** allows you to change the environment and see all app logs. 
> To see the developer mode, you need to fast tap five times on the app version text.
